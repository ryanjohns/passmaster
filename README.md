## Passmaster

Host-Proof password storage using client-side AES-256 encryption. You can see
it live at <https://passmaster.io>.

## Running the server

This project is tested to run on ruby 3.3.8 so you should have that version
installed before starting. Using [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [direnv](https://direnv.net/) is highly recommended and .ruby-version,
.ruby-gemset, and .envrc files are in the project root for keeping your gems organized.
You will also need PostgreSQL (anything 9.1 and newer should work).

 * Fork and clone the repository
 * Create and modify env.local.yml (`cp config/env.yml config/env.local.yml`)
 * Install required gems (`bundle install`)
 * Create and migrate the database (`bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load`)
 * Start the server (`bundle exec puma`)
 * Browse to http://localhost:8000

## Verifying javascript

If you would like to verify that the javascript at passmaster.io has not been
tainted you can do so fairly easily but it does require setting up a development
environment similar to what you would need to work on the project.

 * Clone the repository (`git clone git@github.com:ryanjohns/passmaster.git`)
 * Check out the production branch (`git checkout --track origin/production`)
 * Install required gems (`bundle install`)
 * Run the verification task (`RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:verify`)

## Mobile apps

The mobile apps are simple front-ends for passmaster.io that allow native
access to the clipboard for one-tap copy functionality. The mobile apps also
enable unlocking with biometrics on supported devices.
