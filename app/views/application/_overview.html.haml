            Your account details are for your eyes only so everything is encrypted with javasript directly on your
            computer or mobile device before being saved to the cloud. Only you know the master
            password so no one, not even the server admins, can see anything about your account details.

            Passmaster isn't going anywhere but in the event of an extended outage you will always be able to access your
            accounts details from a backup. Each Passmaster backup contains an "Account Viewer" HTML file which contains
            everything needed to view your account data. Just open the account viewer and use it to decrypt the backup.
            The source code of the account viewer contains all of the javascript required to decrypt your data and is well
            commented, so check it out if you're curious about what's going on under the hood.
