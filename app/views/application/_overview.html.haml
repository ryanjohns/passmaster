            Store Everything
          %p
            Passmaster is designed to store usernames and passwords for all the websites you use but can store
            other related information as well. There's space for account numbers, security questions, website
            URLs, or anything else you might need.

            Secure Password Generator
          %p
            Use the built-in generator to create cryptographically secure random passwords for all your accounts.
            If any one of your passwords is compromised you can easily generate a new one while the rest of your
            accounts remain safe. The length and character set is configurable to match each site's requirements.

            Host-Proof Encryption
          %p
            Your account details are for your eyes only so everything is encrypted with javascript directly on your
            computer or mobile device before being saved to the cloud. Only you know the master
            password so no one, not even the server admins, can see anything about your account details.

            Automatic Backups
          %p
            Enable automatic backups to receive an email with your encrypted account details each time you make a change.
            This is a great way to ensure you always have a backup of your data. You can also download a backup file
            to your computer at any time from your account settings.

            Offline Access
          %p
            Passmaster uses service workers and local storage to make your account details accessible
            even while you are offline. Your data is automatically synced each time you use Passmaster ensuring it is
            available whenever you need it.

            Portable and Durable
          %p
            Passmaster isn't going anywhere but in the event of an extended outage you will always be able to access your
            accounts details from a backup. Each Passmaster backup contains an "Account Viewer" HTML file which contains
            everything needed to view your account data. Just open the account viewer and use it to decrypt the backup.

            Increase the security of your account by enabling multi-factor authentication with Google Authenticator.
            Accessing your accounts from a new device will require a randomly generated password that you can get from
            the Google Authenticator app for
