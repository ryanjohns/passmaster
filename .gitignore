# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#

# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Bundler
/.bundle

!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore sockets, but keep the directory.
/tmp/sockets/*
!/tmp/sockets/
!/tmp/sockets/.keep
